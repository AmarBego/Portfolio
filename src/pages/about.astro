        <p>
            Hello! I'm a web developer and designer based in New York City. I specialize in building fast, responsive websites and web applications using modern technologies like React, Astro, and Tailwind CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about creating beautiful, user-friendly interfaces and experiences that help businesses and individuals achieve their goals. I love working with clients to bring their ideas to life and solve complex problems with simple, elegant solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the city, trying new restaurants, or playing guitar in my band. I'm always looking for new projects and collaborations, so feel free to <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> if you'd like to work together!
